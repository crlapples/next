      description: "Hey there! You can print banners on most Brother QL, RJ, TD, and PT thermal printers, ranging from 1 inch to 4 inches wide and up to 100 feet long. To get started, open Settings, choose your printer, select the paper size, and decide whether you want automatic cutting. On the main screen, type your text or use voice input, and your label will appear instantly. If you’re using a QL-820NWB or QL-810W printer, switch the Black/Red slider to Red, or else red text will print in black. For small labels, use Portrait orientation to fit within the paper's width, while Landscape orientation is ideal for long banners. If you need extra-long prints, set the printer to NO CUT, and you can print continuously. We recommend the DK-4605 label roll, a removable yellow label roll perfect for posters. This app also works with Brother P-touch printers, supporting tapes from 6mm to 36mm wide that are waterproof and long-lasting. Hope you enjoy using the app and have fun creating custom banners!",
